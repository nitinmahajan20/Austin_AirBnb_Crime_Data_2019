# Austin_AirBnb_Crime_Data_2019

## Predicting nightly rates of Airbnb listings in Austin, TX (YEAR_2019) using Machine Learning and Inferential Statistics
## Goal
To predict the rate per night of Airbnb in Austin, TX (YEAR 2019).

## Background
Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. The company is based in San Francisco, California, United States.
The project here looks at the various aspects of Airbnb and see what combination of features will most accurately predict the rate per night of a given listing. Here, I have fosused only on the data collected for the city of Austin, Texas in Year 2019 ( till Novenber). In addition to this, this notebook also shows the crimes reported within the areas as included by the Airbnb dataset.
Finally, a map is generated using the boundaries and zipcodes for better visulaization. WHENEVER we plan our trip, we always look for few major features - reviews, location, property type, parking, breakfast included, cancellation policy and few other. The analysis in this notebook is done including most of these features.
